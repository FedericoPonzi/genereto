CloudFront functions also allow updating HTTP responses. We could write a function to add important HTTP security headers to each response, but a better way would be to configure and use a response header policy. Using a response header policy is declarative and requires no additional code.

Some headers can improve the security of your website by directing browser to behave in a certain way. For example, the HTTP `Strict-Transport-Security` header (HSTS) indicates to the browser to use HTTPS when performing future requests. Another important header is the `Content-Security-Policy` header which restricts which resources the browser can load for the page, for example, by allowing content to be loaded only from the site's origin.
